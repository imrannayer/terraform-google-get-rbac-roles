# Get RBAC Roles Module
This module takes a map of job functions for groups/users/service accounts and returns bindings in format which can be passed to [GCP IAM modules](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-iam). Module does not create any resource. It is used to centrally manage job functions to GCP roles mapping and generate bindings as output.

## Compatibility
This code is intended for use with Terraform 0.14 or higher.

## Usage
Basic usage of this module is as follows:
```terraform
module "get_iam_bindings" {
  source                    = "../get-job-function-roles/"

  groups_users_roles_needed = {
    "group:test-grp-01@example.com"                                         = ["dba"]
    "group:test-grp-02@example.com"                                         = ["developer"]
    "user:test-user-01@example.com"                                         = ["viewer", "support"]
    "serviceAccount:delete-me-svc-acct-1@sinprj.iam.gserviceaccount.com"    = ["developer"]
  }

  custom_iam_job_functions = {
    "sandbox" = [
      "roles/editor",
      "roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor",
    ]
    "dba" = [
      "roles/editor",
    ]
  }
  override_job_functions = false
}
```

## group_user_roles_needed
When this module is called from the root module input is provided in `groups_users_roles_needed` as key value pairs. Key can be `group:group-email`, `user:user-email` or `serviceAccount:service-account-email`. Value contains the list of job functions which are defined in this module or passed in `custom_iam_job_functions`. You can pass 1 or more job functions for each group, user or service account.


Here is an example input

```terraform
  groups_users_roles_needed = {
    "group:test-grp-01@example.com"                                         = ["dba"]
    "group:test-grp-02@example.com"                                         = ["developer"]
    "group:test-grp-03@example.com"                                         = ["viewer", "support"]
    "user:user-01@example.com"                                              = ["viewer", "support"]
    "serviceAccount:delete-me-svc-acct-1@sinprj.iam.gserviceaccount.com"    = ["developer"]
  }
```

## custom_iam_job_functions
Users can also pass their own job functions to GCP roles mapping in `custom_iam_job_functions` variable which is merged with `predefined_iam_job_functions` before generating final bindings. It will allow users take advantage of formatting this module can perform. If a user passes `custom_iam_job_functions` with job function(s) which are already present in `predefined_iam_job_functions` it will override the values if the value of `override_job_functions` is set to `true` otherwise the matching job function(s) will be ignored. In this example since the value of `override_job_functions` is set to true, if `dba` or `sandbox` job functions are already present in `predefined_iam_job_functions` it will be overridden. 

```terraform
module "get_iam_bindings" {
  source                    = "../"

  groups_users_roles_needed = {
    "group:test-grp-01@example.com" = ["dba"]
    "group:test-grp-02@example.com" = ["developer"]
    "group:test-grp-03@example.com" = ["viewer", "support"]
  }

  custom_iam_job_functions = {
    "sandbox" = [
      "roles/editor",
      "roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor",
    ]
    "dba" = [
      "roles/editor",
    ]
  }
  override_job_functions = true
}
```


## How to add or remove mapping in this module

If you are planning to clone this module and host it in your own environment you can add or remove mappings in your cloned repository. Mapping is defined in the `job-roles.tf` file in a local variable `predefined_iam_job_functions`. You can add or remove job functions or GCP roles from a job function. Here is the format:

```terraform
  predefined_iam_job_functions = {
    "job-1" = [
      "roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin",
      "roles/cloudsupport.techSupportViewer",
    ]
    "job2" = [
      "roles/dataflow.admin",
      "roles/dataproc.admin",
    ]
  }
```

### Example:

```terraform
  predefined_iam_job_functions = {
    "dba" = [
      "roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin",
      "roles/cloudsupport.techSupportViewer",
    ]
    "developer" = [
      "roles/dataflow.admin",
      "roles/dataproc.admin",
    ]
  }
```
